# Customer Churn Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of telecom customer churn data to identify reasons for churn. The dataset is cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating data distributions and relationships.
- **Visualizations:** Creating insightful charts to identify trends and patterns.
- **Churn Insights:** Understanding key factors that influence customer churn.
